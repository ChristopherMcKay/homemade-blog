This dream situation happened to me, an Atlanta-based interior designer; in January 2009 a young couple answered an ad I placed on their building''s hallway message board in regard to vintage furniture I was selling. The couple, Jeremy and Amanda, own and operate a hauling company located about 90 minutes outside of Atlanta.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDue to their hectic, loud and physically exhausting work weeks, they decided to turn two small lofts in an ultra-modern, glass-and-concrete high-rise into one large, open and airy two-story loft where they could escape on weekends. In addition to their own rest and relaxation needs, the loft, located in an urban area known as\r\n            Midtown, was also intended as event space, whether for TV and/or music video shoots, or for parties and celebrations\r\n            in need of an urban, contemporary setting with a penthouse-like feel.\r\n         </p> \r\n         <p>\r\n            After meeting the couple for the first time in my previous loft, as I was selling furniture to make room\r\n            for new pieces in my recently purchased house, we instantly hit it off. As Jeremy looked around, he quickly\r\n            inquired as to what things in the loft were available for purchase, from sofas and coffee tables to area rugs\r\n            and art. Eager to pare back my overabundance of sleek, modern, chrome pieces to make room for more Danish modern\r\n            decor in my new house, I quickly made a list of everything Jeremy and Amanda wanted, then got to pricing it\r\n            all out. Before I could even come to a number, the couple asked me to also bid on designing their newly renovated\r\n            loft, not only with items from my old loft, but with new, custom pieces as well.\r\n         </p>\r\n', '2015-06-28 15:21:21'),
(2, 'Brian McClain', 'Featured Neighborhood: SoHo', '<p>\r\nSoHo comprises the area south of Houston Street, west of Lafayette Street, north of Canal Street, and to the east of either theHuson River, Sixth Avenue, or West Broadway, depending on who you ask. While distinct, it shares many characteristics with its downtown neighbors: Greenwich Village to the north, Tribeca to the south and west, and Nolita to the east. An attraction in its own right, SoHo is in many ways the Midtown of Downtown, with packed streets, high-end shopping, and expensive real estate. Much of the area is now a historic district to preserve its unique character, but that hasn&#146;t stopped it from continually ranking as one of New York City&#146;s trendiest neighborhoods in the minds of locals and visitors alike.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSoHo is often thought of as the poster neighborhood for urban regeneration. Originally a manufacturing area for much of the early-to-mid 20th century, SoHo became a haven for artists looking for inexpensive lofts to rent as limited residential space in the city made housing unaffordable. Saved through strong community activism from being torn down to create a highway across Lower Manhattan, it has since transformed and is now appreciated for its wealth of cast iron architecture on a scale found in few other places in the world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo see what SoHo has become -- no longer the neighborhood of sweatshops, but instead a shopping mecca -- is essentially a study in contradictions. Some of New York City&#146;s richer residents pay top dollar to live in cast iron penthouses, while attempts to keep the artistic presence of the area intact have lead to what are essentially artist quotas in residential buildings. Formerly desolate streets are now crowded with visitors seeking the quintessential city experience. Perhaps it is these layers of society that keep people coming back, or maybe it&#146;s the architecture. Either way, SoHo will continue to be fashionable for years to come, bringing with it new residents who wish to keep the city one step ahead.\r\n</p>', '2015-06-28 16:13:20'),

According to RealtyTracs Quarterly Home Flipping Report, investors make a gross profit of $65,993 per flip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the United States real estate market heating up, many people are getting into flipping houses. Cities with the highest number of flips include Detroit, Los Angeles, Memphis, and Miami. Cities with the highest profit on flips include St. Louis, Jacksonville, and Chicago, according to the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How to Find Discount Properties</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first step to flipping a house is finding a discount property. The goal is to buy low and sell high and keep repair costs to a minimum. Fortunately you can find bargain properties in just about every town and city in the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if you live near the Tampa, Florida area, you will find dozens of foreclosure houses listed for under $10,000. Many house rehabbers find undervalued houses by looking for foreclosures/bank owned properties - also called REO houses. Banks have carrying costs on any house in their inventory. Carrying costs include insuranace, taxes, and property maintenance.

You can access to funding to flip houses so that you use only a fraction of your own money.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne way to use other people''s money to flip houses is to get a Hard Money Loan. A Hard Money Lender is an individual, or a group of wealthy individuals, who lend money for the purpose of rehabbing houses. It is a short term loan you repay monthly with the balance paid in full when the house is sold.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGetting a hard money loan is easier than getting a loan from a bank. There is less paperwork and your credit history is not as big of a factor. Often you can receive the funds in 48 to 72 hours. Some Hard Money Lenders provide funding without checking your income or your credit report.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUsing hard money will reduce your overall profit because you pay interest and points on the loan. However, it is a good strategy to use if you do not have funds set aside - or prefer not to put your own money at risk.\r\n</p>', '2015-06-28 16:40:00'),

According to RealtyTrac''s Quarterly Home Flipping Report, investors make a gross profit of $65,993 per flip.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith the United States real estate market heating up, many people are getting into flipping houses. Cities with the highest number of flips include Detroit, Los Angeles, Memphis, and Miami. Cities with the highest profit on flips include St. Louis, Jacksonville, and Chicago, according to the report.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How to Find Discount Properties</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe first step to flipping a house is finding a discount property. The goal is to buy low and sell high and keep repair costs to a minimum. Fortunately you can find bargain properties in just about every town and city in the U.S.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor example, if you live near the Tampa, Florida area, you will find dozens of foreclosure houses listed for under $10,000.\r\nMany house rehabbers find undervalued houses by looking for foreclosures/bank owned properties - also called "REO" houses.
